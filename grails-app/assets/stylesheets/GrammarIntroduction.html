<p>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>This outline or sketch of Cherokee grammar is intended primarily as an aid to the user of the Cherokee-English dictionary.<b><sup>1 </sup></b>The authors hope that Cherokee speakers who utilize the dictionary will acquire a deeper understanding of the complex structure of their language by reading the grammar sketch. Students of Cherokee attempting to learn the language and linguists interested in studying the structure of Cherokee should also find the dictionary and grammar outline useful.</p>

<p>The traditional parts of speech, used to classify the Cherokee entries in the dictionary, provide a useful framework by means of which the non-linguist can understand the grammatical systems of Cherokee. Each of the eight part of speech categories is described in the grammar outline. The first section is devoted to a discussion of the Cherokee verb. Since the structure of verbs in Cherokee is quite complex, this is the longest and most detailed section of the grammar sketch. The structure of Cherokee nouns is described in the second section, and the remaining parts of speech are discussed in the third section. The fourth section of the grammar outline consists of notes on various aspects of Cherokee syntax, the principles of sentence formation in the language .</p>

<p>Throughout the grammar sketch examples are provided for each of the points discussed. In addition to the examples, the first section contains a number of complete and partial verb paradigms. In the examples and paradigms we have chosen to spell final syllables in their entirety, and the reader should remember that final vowels are ordinarily not pronoutnced in spoken Cherokee. Further study of the language is needed to determine the precise nature of the rules which govern the dropping of vowels in various contexts.<b><sup>2</sup></b></p>

<p >Those examples in the grammar outline which can stand alone as sentences are followed by periods and are translated by sentences in English. This practice is not followed in the case of examples which cannot stand alone as sentences. In addition to the discussion of the various grammar points and the examples which illustrate them, the reader is urged to study the illustrative sentences in the dictionary. These sentences provide further insight into the structure of the Cherokee language.</p>

<p><b><sup>1</sup></b>We would like to thank Bill Cook for discussing various aspects of Cherokee with us, and for pointing out a number of facts regarding the future tense prefix and the suffix system of the verb. We would also like to thank Willard Walker for generously making available to us many of his unpublished materials on Cherokee. We have also profited from reading Reyburn's study of Cherokee morphology (&quot;Cherokee Verb Morphology I, II,&quot; <u>International Journal of American Linguistics</u>, 19: 172-180, 259-73, and &quot;Cherokee Verb Morphology III&quot; , <u>International Journal of American Linguistics</u>, 20:44-64).</p>

<p><strong><sup>2</sup></strong>Final vowels are more often retained at the end of sentences or utterances than elsewhere, apparently indicating that they function as carriers of the final part of intonation contours. The retention or dropping of final vowels also seems to mark the extent of formality of various speech styles; many more final vowels are retained in oratorical style than in casual spoken style, for example.</p>
