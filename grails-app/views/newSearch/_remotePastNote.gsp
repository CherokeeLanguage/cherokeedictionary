<b>Remote past tense</b>: actions that occurred yesterday or earlier, that were experience by the speaker or otherwise known definitively to have occurred.<br/>
Remote past tense is constructed by adding appropriate prefixes to the remote past tense verb stem. The verb stem is the verb root plus the tense suffix along (-vi for remote past) with changes to the root caused by sound juxtapositions.<br/>
To find the remote past tense stem, remove the prefixes from the "Verb 3rd past" entry. Unless there are other pre-pronominal prefixes required for this verb (like w(i)-, d(a)-, or n(i)-), those prefixes  are either u- (before stems beginning in a consonant) or uw- (before stems beginning in a vowel).<br/>
Thus, the basic remote past tense is:<br/>
<b>*pronominal prefixes + verb root (along with sound changes) + remote past tense suffix (vi)</b><br/>
(*plus any obligatory pre-pronominal prefixes required for this specific verb, like w(i)-, d(a)-, or n(i)-).<br/>
Note: if the action was not directly experienced but reported by others (like in a story) or there is any doubt that it absolutely occurred, then use the reportative past tense. Thatâ€™s easy, just use -ei instead of -vi for the tense suffix.<br/>
Additional prefixes and suffixes can be added to modify the meaning of most verbs. Explanations of these can be found in the following resources:<br/>
