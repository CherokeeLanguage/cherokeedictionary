<b>Infinitive</b>: used in infinitive clauses (like, "I want (for me) to speak Cherokee").<br/>
Infinitive forms are constructed by adding appropriate prefixes to the infinitive verb stem. The verb stem is the verb root plus the tense suffix along (-di for infinitive) with changes to the root caused by sound juxtapositions and other information necessary to create an infinitive.<br/>
To find the infinitive stem, remove the prefixes from the "Verb 3rd infinitive" entry. Unless there are other pre-pronominal prefixes required for this verb (like w(i)-, d(a)-, or n(i)-), those prefixes  are either u- (before stems beginning in a consonant) or uw- (before stems beginning in a vowel).<br/>
Thus, the basic infinitive is:<br/>
<b>*pronominal prefixes + verb root (along with sound changes) + infinitive suffix (di)</b><br/>
(*plus any obligatory pre-pronominal prefixes required for this specific verb, like w(i)-, d(a)-, or n(i)-).<br/>
The infinitive form is also a common way to construct nouns from verbs (like speech from "to speak"). Additional prefixes and suffixes can be added to modify the meaning of most verbs. Explanations of these concepts can be found in the following resources:<br/>
